# A low quality speech synthesizer

This is an **unfinished** speech synthesizer made with C\+\+, [PortAudio](https://www.portaudio.com/), and [Dear ImGUI](https://www.dearimgui.com/). It uses Linear Predictive Coding to synthesize speech.

## Usage

- You can't use this yet

To compile this yourself, you need a C++ compiler (gcc, clang, mingw) and some build tools (make). Make sure [PortAudio](https://www.portaudio.com/) is installed so it can link properly. Just run `make` and it should work.

## FAQ

### Can you think of a better name for this than "synth"?**

I have an idea, and might rename this repository sometime later.

- linear predictive coding &rarr; lin &rarr; forest
- singing &rarr; aria &rarr; ria

**forestria** *vocal synth*!

### Why are you working on this?**

Because of *procrastination*.

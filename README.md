# A low quality speech synthesizer

This is an **unfinished** speech synthesizer made with C\+\+, [PortAudio](https://www.portaudio.com/), and [Dear ImGUI](https://www.dearimgui.com/). It uses Linear Predictive Coding to synthesize speech.

## FAQ

**Can you think of a better name for this than "synth"?**

I have an idea, and might rename this repository sometime later.

- linear predictive coding &rarr; lin &rarr; forest
- singing &rarr; aria &rarr; ria

**forestria** *vocal synth*!

**Why are you working on this?**

Because of *procrastination*.

# A low quality speech synthesizer

This is an **abandoned** speech synthesizer made with C\+\+, [PortAudio](https://www.portaudio.com/), and [Dear ImGUI](https://www.dearimgui.com/). It uses Linear Predictive Coding to synthesize speech.

Please note that the code is REALLY BAD and uses GOTOs and Mutexes improperly. Do not try to learn from my code. 

## Usage

- You can't use this yet

To compile this yourself, you need a C++ compiler (gcc, clang, mingw) and some build tools (make). Make sure [PortAudio](https://www.portaudio.com/) and glfw is installed so it can link properly. I do not have any binaries right now

## FAQ

### What is this called

**forestria** (no not really)

### Why are you working on this?

I made this mainly to learn about synthesis and refresh my C++ skills. There are many mistakes throughout the code here, but I still managed to fufill all my goals, so I'm considering this done.

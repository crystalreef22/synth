IF ANYOne can think of a phrase that sounds less ridiculous to say, please let me know

- Say the phrase relatively monotonously, but it's fine if not
    - The pitch should be something around your natural speaking frequency
- Do not rush, take your time on each syllable
- If you messed up, just go back and correct the mistake, then continue
